# NHLDataPipeline
This Repo is mainly used to help me understand Datapipelines and how to integrate Python, SQL and other languages together allowing for quick and easy access to stats that are then able to be plotted, or configured in a dashboard.

# Purpose
I really want to delve into the world of Sports Data Science and visualization. So, the purpose and mentality I am treating this repo with is that I am a Data Scientist for the Vancouver Cancucks (Go Cancuks Go!), and want to create evaluation schemes for players currently on the roster and evaluating players to bring into the roster. 

## Adaptations
As I know not everyone is a Canucks fan, I do plan on making these more generalized where you can just define your team by their abbreviation, and then call it a day.
